SCVim 

This is based of the original scvim by Alex Norman (see: http://www.x37v.info/scvim/)
Reworked by Stephen Lumenta 2010

The plugin uses pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to keep your .vim paths clean.
It should work with the least amount of setup as possible.

Installation:

Drop the whole scvim folder into your "bundle" folder, e.g. "~/.vim/bundle/scvim"
