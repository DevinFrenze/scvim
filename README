SCVim 

This is based of the original scvim by Alex Norman (see: http://www.x37v.info/scvim/)

The plugin uses pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to keep your .vim paths clean.

There are plenty of known issues - better wait until this gets stabler / easier to use:

* rather macvim centric ( help tries to open macvim - this should be done automatically)
* it is still to fiddly to enter the supercollider paths
* probably a lot more

Installation:

Drop the whole scvim folder into your "bundle" folder, e.g. "~/.vim/bundle/scvim" 
Symlink SCVim.sc somewhere, where SuperCollider can find it. On a mac that would
be 

ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/supercollider/sc/SCVim.sc ~/Library/Application\
		 Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/SCVim.sc

The rest should hopefully work automatically. Edit plugin/supercollider.vim to
taste.

To start open a file with the right extension
:e foo.scd
